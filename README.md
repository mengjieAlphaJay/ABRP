# Adaptive Branch Reasoning Prompting Enhances Literature-based Scientific Reasoning

This repository contains the code implementation and data for the paper titled "Adaptive Branch Reasoning Prompting Enhances Literature-based Scientific Reasoning." 

To improve clarity, we updated the README.md with diagrams to clarify the method and input/output examples. We include an example using the Paper Source Tracing (PST) task to further elucidate the methods discussed in the paper.

## Data Preparation

1. Cleaned Paper Source Tracing data is located in `dataset/PST`.
2. CSV files downloaded from Huggingface are placed in `dataset/relish`.
3. The Cora/PubMed datasets can be downloaded from [this link](http://example.com).

## Installation

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.py
```


## How to Run the Code

### Initialize Task Agent

For classification tasks:

For proximity tasks:

```
from predata.PromxAgent import PromxAgent
from predata.RELData import RelishData
from predata.PSTdata import PSTData

# PST
pstdata = PSTData()
agent = PromxAgent(pstdata,"pst")
# Relish
reldata = RelishData(False)
agent = PromxAgent(reldata,'relish')
```

### Adaptive Boosting

1. Initialize the `Retriever` class.
2. Run `adaBoT.py` to perform boosting:
   ```python
   ABoT = Booster(agent, retr)
   ABoT.Boosting()
   # Output: weak learners with weight: msg/boost_alpha.json
   ```
3. Generate branch reasoning demonstrations:
   ```python
   from ABRP import PSTRunner

   pst_runner = PSTRunner(agent)
   pst_runner.generate_BRD_prompts()
   # Output: prompts for generating BRD
   ```
4. Construct ABRP prompts:
   ```python
   pst_runner.ABRP_prompts()
   ```

### Example

Using the adaptive Branch-of-thought, you will obtain different decomposition strategies and their weights:

```python
{"idea+method":0.2, "method+goal":0.1, ...}
```

Running the branch reasoning demonstrations generator module will yield:

```python
(METHOD) Methodology: Assign ’m_score’ 0, 1, 2 to assess whether it adopts or expands the method M introduced in the Reference.
Example: The Query introduces a new framework, Defense-GAN, which leverages generative models, thus adopting the methodology. Consequently, the m_score is 2. However, the other references discuss existing methods and vulnerabilities without proposing a new methodology that the Query adopts. Consequently, the m_score is 0.

(THEORY/EXPER) Theoretical Foundation/Experimental Design: Assign ’e_score’ 0, 1, 2 to evaluate if the Query uses the new theory, experimental design, implementation, or tool proposed by the Reference. 
Example: The Query utilizes the concept of generative models to defend against adversarial attacks, which aligns with the theoretical foundation of the Reference that discusses vulnerabilities in DNNs. Consequently, the e_score is 2. However, the other references provide insights into adversarial sample crafting and defenses but do not directly inspire the Query’s theoretical approach. Consequently, the e_score is 0.
```

Final ABRP prompts example:

```python
Determine whether the references are the source paper of the Query. When reasoning, you should identify the specific aspects and discuss their relationship:
Query: Title: Wide Activation for Efficient and Accurate Image Super-Resolution. Abstract: In this report we demonstrate that with same...
Methodology: Assign a score {0, 1, 2} to assess whether it adopts or expands the method introduced in the Reference.
Example: The Query introduces a new framework, Defense-GAN, which leverages generative models, thus adopting the methodology. Consequently, the score is 2. However, the other references discuss existing methods... Thus, the score is 0.
Idea: Assign A score {0, 1, 2} to evaluate if the Query’s idea, motivation or core concept are inspired by the Reference.
Example: The core idea of the Query is inspired by... attacks on classifiers, which resonates with the findings in the Reference about... Thus, the score is 2. However, the other references do not provide an idea that influences the motivation. Consequently, the score is 0.
